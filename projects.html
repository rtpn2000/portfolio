          <ul>
            <p>DVPO StaG is a chatbot system designed to support survivors of domestic violence in Washington State by helping them file for Domestic Violence Protection Orders (DVPOs). The platform focuses on legal precision, and accessibility, ensuring that survivors feel heard, supported, and guided throughout a difficult legal process.</p>
